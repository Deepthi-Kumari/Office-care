# Office-care
Due to the pandemic, life is really been on threat now for everyone
especially for office going people. The same threat prevails for
employees when customers visit their shops. As a thought of bringing
relief upto an extent by proper sanitization in these cases, you are
expected to bring an IoT solution. In addition to the normal glass
door of the office, there should be one another pass gate (pass gate
like what we see at libraries or metro railway stations which opens
when access is granted).
When people come to the office, the glass door opens automatically as
a sign of welcoming them. But when they pass the glass door and come
inside, there is this pass gate. The pass gate will be opened only if
they are sanitized. There are automatic sanitizer dispensers for this
purpose. When the person stretches hands towards the dispenser, it
dispenses the liquid and giving a few seconds for them to rub the
liquid well on their hands, the pass gates will be opened for 3
seconds by simultaneously denoting the green light blink thrice and
then with a long beep sound the red light turns on denoting the
closure of gate.
